# FizzBuzz Open Source

## Description

Welcome to FizzBuzz Open Source! This is a democratized, open-source project with a single aim: to bring together coders from around the world to contribute their unique solutions to the classic FizzBuzz problem. We hope to build the most comprehensive collection of FizzBuzz solutions, each reflecting the diverse perspectives and approaches of our global contributor base.

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a time-honored programming challenge, often used in coding interviews. The challenge is to print numbers from 1 to 100, but there are a few twists:

- For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Why democratized?

We believe that everyone, regardless of their coding proficiency level, can bring a unique perspective to solving problems. Therefore, we invite contributions from everyone. Whether you're a seasoned programmer, a newbie, or someone in between, your solution matters to us!

## Contribution

Everyone is welcome to contribute! Check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information on how you can add your unique touch to FizzBuzz Open Source.

## Languages

Our goal is to amass FizzBuzz solutions in as many programming languages as possible. If you know a language that hasn't been used yet in our project, we encourage you to add your contribution!
